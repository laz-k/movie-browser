This project is part of "Section 15: React 201" of "The Ultimate 2021 Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. I've learned about useState & useEffect and used TMDB's API to fetch movie data. 
The final assignment was to implement some new features to the site e.g add a 404 page, handle missing poster images, handle no search results and adding functionality to search button. 
I have also added popular movies on home page and more information in detailed view.
